I'm a research technologist and neuroscientist particularly interested in using generative AI to support novel multimodal human-computer interaction. Prior to what I do now at the Champalimaud Foundation, I worked on [BMIs](https://www.kernel.com/) and as a [PhD student](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Eric-Lacosse-2142846982) at the Max Planck Institute for [Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/person/elacosse) and [Biological Cybernetics](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/114771/602940).


I'm always eager to connect and collaborate, especially with industry partners. I'm best reached via email.
