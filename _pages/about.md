I'm research technologist and neuroscientist particularly interested in cognitive maps, generative AI to support novel multimodal human-computer interaction, and conversational language agents. Prior to joining the Champalimaud Foundation, I worked on [BMIs](https://www.kernel.com/) and as a [PhD student](https://is.mpg.de/person/elacosse).
