Palimpsest is an interactive art-science installation that allowed participants to draw using an Apple Pencil on an iPad. These drawings were then translated into a series of "metamers" using image-to-image transformations. While these image transformations took place, an "AI narrator" interpreted participants' art-work using a stylized CLIP inversion. Exhibited at Metamersion 2023, Champalimaud Center for the Unknown.
